# InsuranceRegressionProjectGoogleBangkit2021

This project is another part of lessons that I got from Google Bangkit 2021 as a practice for Regression lessons that I learned before. In the code you can see I do a few things as follows:

1. Do a simple Exploratory Data Analysis before feeding the data to the model
2. Build Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor with Scikit-learn also Neural Network Model with Tensorflow
3. Do an evaluation for each model with some evaluation metrics like r2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE. I also visualize the actual vs predicted plots and residual plots to know how the data fitted to the model
4. The conclusion is the best model that fitted was Gradient Boosting Regressor with the score of:
- R2 Score: 0.896613082323638
- Mean Squared Error: 16451956.31444019
- RMSE: 4056.101122314407
- Mean Absolute Error: 2454.919789299805
